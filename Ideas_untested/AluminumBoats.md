# Aluminum Foil Boats



## Goal
Goal: The the question below try to answer or at least cause wonder:
* ***How Can a 2 Ton Steel Boat Float?***


## Materials
* Square sheet of aluminum Foil
* About 100 pennies
* Tub/sink filled with water
* Optional: Make Aluminum foil sink challenge
* Optional: Cargo challenge
  * All of the above
	* Hair drier or strong fan
	* Lego people
	* Something to make a sail mask
	   * Straw, paper and clay? see [Pilgrim Challenge](https://jdaniel4smom.com/2017/11/build-pilgrims-boat-stem-challenge.html)


## Time
* 15-30 minutes

## Lesson


Aluminum foil is about 2.7 denser than water.  So it will sink when dropped into water.  

Density is the mass of the object divided by the volume.  

This lesson is all about maximizing the density of an object to hold the most mass (e.g. pennies).  

For additional, challenges have the students try to minimize the aluminum foil to the point that it sinks.  

Lastly, boat need to do more that simply float.  They have to be stable too in windy conditions.  The cargo challenge will test how stable their boat.  Making it more stable will most likely cause it to hold less pennies.


## Steps: Boat Challenge

***NOTE:*** It is really hard to make aluminum foil sink in water since it wants to create lots of crumpled air pockets.  Those making it less dense.

***IMPORTANT****
To show that the material really wants to sink.  Wrap a few pennies within the aluminum foil, and then drop it in.  It will sink really fast.  

Then ask the students to build a boat to hold at least 50 pennies.



## Level of effort
* Easy

## Clean up: Level of effort
* Easy

## Pointers
* For the first experiment: Have the winner kept the pennies their boat holds
* Do have the kids try to sink their Aluminum boat at the end.  It is harder than it seems.
