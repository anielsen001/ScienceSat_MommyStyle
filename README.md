# Science Saturday Mommy Style
![](./images/sciencesat.jpg )
Science Saturday with a Mom.

Backyard science with common household equipment.
My goal is to show that science is:
* Interesting
* Does not need expensive equipment
* Something you can do at home
* A kid (at heart too) can do
* Emphasize that science is all around us and not just happens in a lab.  
    * One way to do that, is to use everyday objects to do science.
