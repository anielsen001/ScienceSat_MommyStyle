# Science Saturday Mommy Style
![](./images/sciencesat.jpg )
Science Saturday with a Mom.

Backyard science with common household equipment.
My goal is to show that science is:
* Interesting
* Does not need expensive equipment
* Something you can do at home
* A kid (at heart too) can do
* Emphasize that science is all around us and not just something that happens in a lab.  
    * One way to do that, is to use everyday objects to do science.

## Light Lessons:
* [Laser Jello](LaserJello.md)


## Chemistry Lessons:
* [Water Electrolysis](WaterElectrolysis.md)
* [Coin Battery](CoinBattery.md)
* [Sodium](Sodium.md)  Still working on

Work in progress (e.g. Not done yet):
** [Soap Foam](SoapFoam.md)

## Physics Lessons:
Works in progress (i.e. Not done yet):
* [Super Cooled Water](CoolWater.md)
* [Plasma with Grapes](PlasmaGrapes.md)
* [Aluminum Boats: Volume](AlBoats.md)

## Electronics Lessons:
* [Coin Battery](CoinBattery.md)


## One Hour Fun
### Chemistry 101
* [Water Electrolysis](WaterElectrolysis.md)
* [Coin Battery](CoinBattery.md)

## Watch on YouTube ONLY
There are cool experiments out there that one should not do at home but they are still pretty cool.  Below are experiments that you should just watch from a safe distance.
* [Glow Water](GlowWater.md)
