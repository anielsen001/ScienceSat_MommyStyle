# Contributing

Thank you! Thank you for helping one mom spread the fun to science to kids.  I really do want to 
hear what changes you think will make this site better!  Please, keep in mind I am a very tired
mom and it does sometimes take time for me to get back.  I really do want to keep the experiments
simple, cheap and safe.  So if it does not contain all three it most likely will not be accepted.

Also, I will only accept experiments that I have sucessfully ran in my backyard.  I do have a graduate 
degree in experimental physics, so if I can't succeed then I think a 4th grader will not be able to 
do this experiment.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.
